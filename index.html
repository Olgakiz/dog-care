          <h2>Proper Nutrition</h2>
          <p>A healthy, balanced diet is a fundamental part of basic dog care. Do some research into food companies that pledge to use high-quality ingredients and formulate foods that are nutritionally complete and balanced. Then, choose a quality diet that your pet enjoys. Spending lots of money on a holistic, top-of-the-line diet may not be necessary but you shouldn't skimp either.</p>

          <h2>A Space of Its Own</h2>
          <p>Dogs are social animals and they are generally not content when excluded from the family unit. Though some circumstances may require dogs to live outside, most will thrive when they can be with "their" people indoors.

            Your dog should have an area of the house dedicated as being its own space, such as a kennel, crate, or bed. This is where your dog can go for some down time when things get a little overwhelming. Set your ground rules, enforce off-limit areas of the house, and welcome your dog into permissible areas.</p>

            <h2>Physical Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Keep your dog healthy with regular exercise and preventive veterinary care. Establish an exercise routine, even if it's just a stroll around the block once a day. Depending on the breed, your dog may require more exercise to burn off extra energy and keep it fit.

              Establish a good relationship with a veterinarian and schedule a wellness check-up for your dog at least once or twice a year. Quite often, potential problems can be identified and treated before your dog shows signs of illness. Within just a few visits, your vet will get to know you and your dog and be able to make recommendations for any health, nutrition, or behavior questions you have.</p>
